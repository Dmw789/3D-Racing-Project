# 3D-Racing-Project

Files containing the behavioral definitions of a 3D racing game project that is currently being developed in Unreal Engine 4.
The project is a proof of concept that is meant to highlight the various programming principles learned at Edinboro University
and how those principles apply to careers in the software engineering industry as a whole.

This project is to be shown off at various conferences and open houses by the CSCI department at Edinboro University.

Currently more than these files are necessary to build the executable in which case if you are interested please refer to my
profile with any inquiries.
